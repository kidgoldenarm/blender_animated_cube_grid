# blender_animated_cube_grid
A python script for Blender to create and animate a 10x10 grid of cubes


You can either import this script into Blender from the scripting view/mode and open it from the text files or you can just copy and paste it directly into the text editor in Blender

This script will:

-create a 10x10 grid of cubes
-create and add them to an object collection called 'Cubes'
-create keyframes and scale them on the timeline

You will have to modify the materials yourself

Also no camera object or light object will be present after running this script so you will have to add them back yourself
